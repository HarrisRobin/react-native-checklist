# **React Native Starters**

There are many starter kits for react-native out there. I highly recommend you go through them and pick the one that fits you best, however if you don't know where to start, the recommended place to start is with [create-react-native-app.](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)

If you do not mind learning and getting a lot of boilerplate, here are some interesting alternatives:

### [Ignite-ir-boilerplate](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-ir-boilerplate)

This boilerplate can be the ideal choice for people who already know that Expo is not a great fit for them \(e.g: they need modules that are not compatible with Expo\) and/or for people that want to use technologies such as redux, redux-sagas and react-navigation since it comes with all of that pre-configured with best practices.
